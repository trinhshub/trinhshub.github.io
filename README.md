Hello! I'm Trinh, a transportation engineering master's student at the University of Texas at Austin. I created this Github page mainly to share the work I conducted during my masters program. I am interested in various issues in the fields of transportation asset management and network modeling. Besides, you can also find pictures from my past extracurricular activities and work experiences. Have fun exploring!

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to send me an email. My contact can be found at the end of this page.

## Transportation Asset Management
During my masters program, I worked on a part of the 10-Year Management Plan sponsored by the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT). I was tasked with developing an excel-based tool to compute bridge asset values on individual and network level. This project requires conducting research related to bridge asset valuation, management practice, and performance prediction. 

Some features of the tool:
  - Estimating crash rates of bridges using regression and historical crash data from TxDOT's CRIS Database
  - Computing bridge values using various traditional valuation models
  - Computing bridge values using bridge utilities
  - Comparing investment alternatives
  - Predicting future performance

## Network Modeling
There are several projects within this field that I conducted:
1  Agent-based Modeling: Simulating Downtown Austin Network using Anylogic
This project is still in progress, but the goal is to estimate the effect of disruptions to the transportation network caused by failures of real-time navigation and the GPS.

2  Python Programing: Measuring the Effects of Operating Navigation Apps on the Network
This project uses Python to simulate a network with drivers with access to real-time data before their trips (at time t0), during their trips (at time t1), and with no access.

Case Study

Results from running the simulations:
1. More people with real-time data access will increase flow efficiency (decrease average travel time in the whole system).
2. No difference between accessing the data before or during the trips.
