Hello! My name is Trinh, and I'm a current transportation engineering master's student at the University of Texas at Austin. I created this Github page to share transportation knowledge and the projects I conducted during my masters program. I am interested in various issues in traffic engineering and bridge management. Besides, you can also find pictures from my past extracurricular activities and work experiences. Have fun exploring!

If you have any questions, please shoot me an email. My contact can be found at the end of this page.

## What is Traffic Engineering?
**Traffic engineering** is a branch of civil engineering that uses engineering techniques to achieve the safe and efficient movement of people and goods on roadways.

## From Incompetent to Expert
Growing up without a strong academic background, I don't have good study habits which led to my struggles with improving my productivity. I've seen many people like me, who are told that they are smart, yet don't get much work done. At some point, I started to wonder if it is my ability-to-know-what-needs-to-be-done (which some could perceive as smartness) actually hinders my ability to get work done. I often come up with lots of ideas and layout plans, then feel overwhelmed with the plans. So I wrote down this system of productivity to remind myself that I can only get as much work done as my perserverance allows me to. The goal of this system is to stay on the diagonal line and slowly enhance both axes simultaneously to move up to the Expert point.
