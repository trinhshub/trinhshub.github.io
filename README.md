Hello! My name is Trinh, and I'm a current traffic engineer-in-training at Jacobs. During my master's program at the University of Texas at Austin, I created this Github page to share transportation knowledge and the projects I conducted. I graduated in June 2020 and got to work on some exciting projects in the industry as well, so I'm turning this page into a catalog of my projects. I am interested in various issues in traffic engineering and bridge management. Besides work, you can also find pictures from my past extracurricular activities and work experiences. Have fun exploring!

If you have any questions, please shoot me an email. My contact can be found at the end of this page.

## What is Traffic Engineering?
**Traffic engineering** is a branch of civil engineering that uses engineering techniques to achieve the safe and efficient movement of people and goods on roadways.

**Fun Fact:** August 5th is International Traffic Light Day. On this day in 1914, the first electrical traffic signal was installed on the corner of Euclid Ave & East 105th St in Cleverland, Ohio.

## From Incompetent to Expert
Growing up without a strong academic background, I didn't have good study habits which led to my struggles with improving my productivity. I've seen many people with the same issues. At some point, I started to wonder if it is the ability-to-know-what-needs-to-be-done (which some could perceive as smartness) actually hinders productivity rather than helping it. I often come up with lots of ideas and layout plans, then feel overwhelmed with the plans. So I wrote down this system of productivity to remind myself that I can only get as much work done as my perserverance allows me to. Both Smartness and Perseverance can become constraints when maximizing productivity. The goal of this system is to stay on the diagonal line and slowly enhance both axes simultaneously to move up to the highly productive point.

  The Productivity System.

Looking at this chart, my friend had an interesting comment about his progress: "I think I am on the line and having a good balance, but to get to this point, my progress did not move in a straight line but waggled around the optimal productivity line like a sine graph." My own take from this chart is that it is important to realize where you are on the chart, because at times, reducing the scope of what you're trying to do or working less can help you to get work done more efficiently, therefore optimize productivity.
