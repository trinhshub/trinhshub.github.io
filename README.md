Hello! My name is Trinh, and I'm a current transportation engineering master's student at the University of Texas at Austin. I created this Github page to share transportation knowledge and the projects I conducted during my masters program. I am interested in various issues in traffic engineering and asset management. Besides, you can also find pictures from my past extracurricular activities and work experiences. Have fun exploring!

If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to send me an email. My contact can be found at the end of this page.
