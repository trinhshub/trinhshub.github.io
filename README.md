## Project 1. _Austin District Bridge Valuation Tool_
Sponsor: TxDOT

Description: This project involves developing a methodology to capture both tangigle and intangble values of bridges under Austin District's management, then, base on this methododology, creating a user-friendly valuation tool for agencywide implementation.

Progress:

[x] Data Compilation

[x] Methodology Framework

[x] Performance Indicators Sensitivity Analysis

[x] Tool Interface

[ ] Guide Book

## Project 2. _Assessing Impacts of Operating In-Vehicle Information System_
Conference Project

[x] Data Compilation

[x] Methodology Framework

[ ] Simulation Results

[ ] Report for Publication

Highlight: An application on Austin Downtown Network with AnyLogic Simulation.

Visual presentations: Coming soon!

## Mini Project: _Measuring Effects of Operating Navigation Apps on the Network_
Class Project

Description: Using Python to simulate a network with drivers with access to real-time data before their trips (at time t0), during their trips (at time t1), and with no access.

Simulation Results:
1. More people with real-time data access will increase flow efficiency (decrease average travel time in the whole system).
2. No difference between accessing the data before or during the trips.

## Mini Project: _Predicting Crashes on Texas Highway Network Using Random Forest vs. Safety Prediction Functions by FHWA*_
Class Project
_*Note: FHWA (Federal Highway Administration)_

Highlights: Using ArcGIS to combine crashes with highway network from different open data sources of TxDOT.
