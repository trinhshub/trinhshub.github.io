## What is Traffic Engineering?
**Traffic engineering** is a branch of civil engineering that uses engineering techniques to achieve the safe and efficient movement of people and goods on roadways.

**Fun Fact:** August 5th is International Traffic Light Day. On this day in 1914, the first electrical traffic signal was installed on the corner of Euclid Ave & East 105th St in Cleverland, Ohio.

## Productivity
Growing up I did not have good study habits, which led to my struggles with improving productivity. I spent a lot of time questioning the relationship between working smart vs. working hard. In one of those times, I created the chart below which I called a system of productivity. The main idea of this chart is that you can only get as much work done as your Cognitive Ability and Perseverance allow you to, which means that both of them can become constraints when maximizing your productivity.

  The Productivity System.

With society constantly pushing you to hustle, I often feel that I am not working hard enough. However, I later became aware that I actually have been on both sides of that line, but it was just harder to recognize and admit that you are in the pink zone. Hardworking is often seen as a positive trait, but in fact, working hard when your cognitive ability cannot handle the work is even more dangerous. I've learned that the pink zone is when you start creating mistakes and wasting effort without even knowing that (The von Manstein Matrix does carry some truths in it). It would also lead to unnecessary burnout and resentment.

It is very important to realize which side you are on so that you can adjust your behaviors. Sometimes, when it is impossible to work harder, reducing the scope of what you're trying to do or working less can help you to get work done more efficiently, therefore optimize productivity. Other times, when you keep making mistakes and feeling overwhelmed, try taking breaks to improve your cognitive ability by reading books, educating yourself, meditate, and exercise. The goal is to stay on the diagonal line and slowly enhance both axes simultaneously to move up to the highly productive point.
